    <h2>Realtime System Architecture & Limits</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Topology & Mechanism</h3>
    <p>
        The WebsimSocket system utilizes a <strong>Relayed Mesh</strong> topology. 
        While it simulates a peer-to-peer environment (where everyone sees everyone's state), 
        all traffic is routed through a central WebSocket server.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eventual Consistency:</strong> State updates are not atomic transactions. Client A sends an update, Server relays it, Client B receives it. Conflicts are usually last-write-wins based on server arrival time.</li>
        <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> JSON over Secure WebSockets (WSS).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Stability Thresholds (Estimates)</h3>
    <p>Based on standard browser WebSocket implementations and single-threaded JS parsing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stable Peers:</strong> 20-30 active peers sending 10 updates/second (Game Loop frequency) is generally smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Degraded Peers:</strong> 50+ peers. You will likely experience "Rubber-banding" as the main thread struggles to parse 50 incoming JSON packets every 100ms.</li>
        <li><strong>Maximum Theoretical Peers:</strong> ~100-200. At this level, the system functions as a chat room, but real-time movement will lag significantly. The bottleneck is client-side JSON parsing and rendering, not necessarily the server bandwidth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Data Constraints</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Room State:</strong> Shared global state. Do not use Arrays; use Objects/Dictionaries. Arrays merge poorly in realtime systems. Large state objects (>1MB) will cause noticeable hitches when updated.</li>
        <li><strong>Presence:</strong> Ephemeral. Ideal for cursors, avatars, and high-frequency data. If a client disconnects, their presence is automatically garbage collected.</li>
        <li><strong>Events:</strong> Fire-and-forget. Not guaranteed to arrive in order, or at all if the network hiccups. Use for sounds/particles, never for game logic (like "Player Died").</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Testing Methodology</h3>
    <p>
        To truly determine the "Maximum Number of Peers", you cannot use a single client. 
        <strong>Open this URL in 10-20 separate tabs</strong>. 
        Use the "Throughput" tool in each tab to simulate load, then watch the "Latency" tab in your main window to see how RTT degrades as node count increases.
